/**
 * Tool classes — MCPL RFC-008
 * (https://github.com/anima-research/mcpl/blob/main/RFC-008-tool-classes.md).
 *
 * Each classed tool in `tools/list` carries `_meta["mcpl/class"]`: what the
 * tool does, in a fixed vocabulary. It is a hint hosts use as a policy key,
 * for example to decide which tool calls a lifecycle observer may see. It
 * grants nothing and never changes the tool the model sees.
 *
 * The rule: a tool that carries or reads people's messages is classed
 * `comms`. Hosts never share `comms` arguments, so a messaging tool classed
 * without `comms` could expose a private conversation. A tool may have
 * several classes and hosts apply the strictest, so the send tools are also
 * `files` (their attachments may be local paths). A tool with no class is
 * handled most restrictively, so leaving one out (UNCLASSED) is always safe;
 * mislabelling one is not.
 *
 * Every tool the server can list must be in TOOL_CLASSES or UNCLASSED;
 * test/toolClasses.test.ts fails otherwise.
