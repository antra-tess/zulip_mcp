 *   - discovering channels and describing them (ChannelDescriptor)
 *   - delivering outgoing publishes (with thread routing where supported)
 *   - fetching recent history for context/beforeInference injections
 *   - streaming real-time incoming messages (self-filtered)

 * Channel IDs are prefixed with the adapter's `type` ('zulip:...',

 * and never inspects the remainder.
