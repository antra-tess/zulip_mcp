 * platform plugs into, and it costs nothing to keep. An adapter owns one
 * platform connection and is responsible for:
 *   - discovering channels and describing them (ChannelDescriptor)
 *   - delivering outgoing publishes (with thread routing where supported)
 *   - fetching recent history for context/beforeInference injections
 *   - streaming real-time incoming messages (self-filtered)
 *
 * Channel IDs are prefixed with the adapter's `type` ('zulip:...'); the MCPL
 * layer routes purely on that prefix and never inspects the remainder.
